    My research is in the area of behavioral Microeconomic theory. In
    particular, my research agenda focuses on sequential games of imperfect
    information. I study settings in which not only do agents face imperfect
    information in the traditional sense of not possessing all payoff-relevant
    information, but they also face uncertainty about their position of movement
    in the sequence. I have utilized this framework to study financial
    investment decisions by individuals, production decisions by firms, and
    implications on information aggregation in observational learning.

    <div class="experience-description">
      I present an investment environment wherein investors demand an asset
      based on perfectly informative signals, but face uncertainty about the
      timing of their information acquisition. I show that this reduces the
      demand and price for every period but that in the limit price as number of
      periods increases price converges to the true value of the asset. By
      introducing a concept of confidence over the time in which they receive a
      signal, I show that the impact of uncertainty can be exaggerated in either
      a negative or positive direction, with the limit price reflecting the true
      value of the asset depending on the type of confidence under
      consideration.

      In a Stackelberg oligopoly setting two firms set quantity without knowing
      whether they are the first or second in the market. I find that with a
      common prior positional uncertainty always leads to a more competitive
      level of quantity. This finding is exacerbated when firms do not share a
      common prior and the sum of their prior beliefs of moving first exceeds
      unity. Even in the presence of a common prior and many identical firms as
      the number of firms increases the equilibrium quantity in the presence of
      positional uncertainty can exceed that of perfect competition.

      I adapt the standard observational learning environment and introduce a
      limited history of observation. When agents can only observe the action of
      the previous agent, complete learning still occurs but with a loss of
      welfare. When a limited history is coupled with uncertainty over position
      in the queue of actors, welfare further drops - increasing in uncertainty
      - but complete learning still occurs in the limit. These results are
      illustrated with a canonical linear model but learning holds in a more
      general setting satisfying the usual social learning assumptions.
